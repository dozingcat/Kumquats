## Rules

The goal is to place letter tiles to form words as quickly as possible. In each game you will
receive a series of tiles, randomly drawn from a set of 144. To finish the game you must arrange
all tiles on the grid in a single connected group, with every horizontal and vertical segment
of two or more tiles forming a valid word.

In this example there are two separate groups (diagonals don't count), and RA is not a valid word.

Adding an I creates a single group with all valid words.

Place a tile by touching it and dragging it to an empty grid square (or to the green section to
temporarily remove it from the grid). You can move the grid by touching an empty area and dragging,
and you can zoom in and out by pinching with two fingers. The grid will automatically expand if you
place a tile near an edge, so you don't have to worry about running out of space.

The game begins with 21 tiles. A new tile will be drawn after one minute, and after that every
10 seconds. You'll draw a new tile immediately if you've arranged all current tiles in a single
group and all words are valid. The total number of tiles in a game can be set to 36, 54, or 72
in the preferences screen.

The list of valid words is similar to the word list used for Scrabble tournaments. It's helpful
to know the more obscure words like AA, AE, OD, QI, and ZA. By default, letter sequences that
don't form valid words are highlighted in red. For increased difficulty, in the preferences screen
you can choose to highlight invalid words only when all tiles have been placed, or not at all.
You can also choose whether Q tiles can be treated as QU, which makes them easier to play.

Yes, all these words are good.
